<p id="paragraph1"> For seven years, Quidditch has been an important aspect in the lives of special a unique group of Pitt students. The bonds made over muddy practices, tournament weekends, and meals at Market have solidified many friendships since its creation. If you've ever been on a campus tour with one of the infamous Pitt Pathfinders, you probably already heard them mention the team. They just mention us for the little much-needed humor during the tour, but there's a lot more to "muggle" Quidditch than kids running around on brooms. </p><br>

<p id="paragraph2"> Believe it or not, universities and communities around the country have formed teams. Originating in Vermont, "muggle" Quidditch has spread across the country, eventually forming a United States Quidditch league. During a typical season, these teams verse one another in tournaments hosted by different universities. These tournaments lead up to regional championships. Some regions include the Mid-Atlantic, Southwest, and Great Lakes, which is where the Pitt team competes every year. </p>
